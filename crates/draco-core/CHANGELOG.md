## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-15

First stable release. The public API is now covered by SemVer (breaking changes
mean a new major version). The `.drc` bitstream it reads and writes is Google
Draco's stable format.

### Added

- Pure-Rust encoder and decoder for Draco `.drc` meshes and point clouds.
- Sequential, KD-tree, and EdgeBreaker connectivity paths; attribute
  quantization, prediction schemes, and normal octahedron transforms.
- Metadata and legacy-bitstream compatibility paths for older Draco streams.
- Feature flags to build decoder-only, encoder-only, or point-cloud-only
  configurations for smaller binaries.
